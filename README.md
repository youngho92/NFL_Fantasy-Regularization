# NFL Fantasy Project

This project is conducted to predict fantasy points for National Football League. I used historical statistics of individual players and teams to predict next-week fantasy points for each player and each team. I used regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net) to avoid overfitting the model.
